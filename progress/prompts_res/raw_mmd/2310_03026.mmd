Summary:

This paper proposes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-making components for autonomous driving systems. The authors address the challenges faced by existing learning-based autonomous driving systems, such as high-level comprehension, rare event generalization, and interpretability. They develop cognitive pathways and algorithms to enable comprehensive reasoning with LLMs and integrate LLM decisions with low-level controllers. The proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in single-vehicle tasks and handles complex driving behaviors. The paper also discusses the background of autonomous driving systems and the application of LLMs, as well as the methods, chain-of-thought, attention allocation, situation awareness and action guidance, multi-vehicle joint control, and text-modulated driving behavior. The conclusion emphasizes the effectiveness of LLMs as decision-makers in autonomous driving and suggests future research directions.

Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of leveraging LLMs for autonomous driving systems, addressing challenges and proposing innovative solutions. The experiments and evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The paper is well-structured and provides valuable insights for researchers in the field. I would recommend this paper with a score of 9 out of 10.
