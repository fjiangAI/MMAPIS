# From Large Language Models to Knowledge Graphs for Biomarker Discovery in Cancer

## Abstract:

The main objective of the research is to develop a domain-specific knowledge graph (KG) for cancer research, which can be used to assist in biomarker discovery and provide interactive question answering. The authors address the challenge of integrating data and knowledge from structured and unstructured sources to create a large-scale KG. They propose the use of a domain ontology called OncoNet Ontology (ONQ) for semantic reasoning in validating gene-disease relations. The KG is enriched with information extracted from scientific articles using BioBERT- and SciBERT-based information extraction methods. Additionally, the authors highlight the importance of incorporating up-to-date findings to prevent concept drift in AI systems. The paper contributes to the fields of bioinformatics, ontology, knowledge graphs, machine learning, and large language models.

## Introduction:

The main motivation of the research is to address the challenging scenario of providing improved diagnosis and treatment for cancer. The authors emphasize the importance of early detection, personalized interventions, and identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer research. They identify machine learning techniques, particularly in the analysis of multimodal data, as valuable tools for cancer research. The authors also highlight the challenges in integrating and extracting knowledge from unstructured data sources, such as scientific literature, and the need for information extraction methods in natural language processing. They mention semantic heterogeneity and the use of Semantic Web technologies, such as knowledge graphs, to address data variety. The authors emphasize the importance of domain ontologies and knowledge bases in supporting multidisciplinary cancer research and clinical decision support. Finally, the authors discuss the challenges in exploring, processing, and analyzing large-scale knowledge graphs and highlight the importance of using up-to-date domain knowledge in AI systems.

## Related Work:

Previous research in the field of life sciences has focused on using semantic technologies such as knowledge bases (KBs) and ontologies to build structured networks of interconnected knowledge. Specifically, research efforts have been made to extract semantic knowledge about cancer from various types of data and construct large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs). Despite these efforts, there is still a lack of comprehensive KGs targeting multiple cancer types. Additionally, the adoption of data-driven approaches in clinical settings has been hindered by the lack of scalable computational methods and the need for reliable and up-to-date information. In terms of natural language processing (NLP), querying or information extraction from structured data is relatively straightforward, but the same tasks from unstructured data, such as text, may require domain-specific and efficient NLP methods. Transformer language models (TLMs) have become the standard for representation learning in NLP.

## Method:

The researchers applied several research methods and techniques in constructing the knowledge graph (KG). The main steps of data collection and analysis include the construction of the ONO Ontology, enrichment of the KG, KG construction, and fine-tuning the KG using language models (LLMs). The ONO Ontology serves as a framework for organizing and representing cancer-related knowledge. The KG is enriched with information extracted from scientific articles and is constructed by integrating cancer-related knowledge from different sources. The KG is further enhanced and refined using LLMs. The methods and techniques used include ontology construction, enrichment of the knowledge graph, integration of cancer-related knowledge, and the use of language models for fine-tuning the KG.

## Model:

The authors developed the Oncogenomics Knowledge Graph (ONO) by reusing existing ontologies and integrating information from various biomedical sources. The ONO is based on the Cancer, Biomarker, and Feature classes, which serve as controlled vocabularies and facts for the knowledge graph. The authors performed instance mapping by assigning unique identifiers to entities in the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph was enriched through the integration of additional facts from recent articles. The authors utilized semantic lexicons and rules from the ontology to enrich the instance information and create RDF triples.

## Fine-tuning KG with LLMs:

The authors discuss the use of Language Models (LLMs) for fine-tuning Knowledge Graphs (KGs). They propose using LLMs to extract up-to-date knowledge and identify inconsistencies in the KG. They employ the supervised fine-tuning approach for training LLMs and instruct the ChatGPT model to generate RDF triples from input prompts. The generated triples are compared with existing triples in the KG, and automated validation of the facts is performed using a semantic reasoner.

## Quality assessment of knowledge graph:

The section focuses on the quality assessment of a knowledge graph (KG). The authors use SANSA-linked data quality assessment metrics to evaluate the fitness of the facts within the KG based on dimensions like availability, completeness, conciseness, interlinking, performance, and relevancy.

The main experimental techniques employed in the research include fine-tuning NER models, using the Adam optimizer, reporting results from random search and cross-validation tests, comparing transformer-based approaches with CRF and Bi-LSTM architectures, providing benchmark queries, reasoning with DLx querying, and interpreting generated rules.

## Analysis of information extraction:

The section discusses the analysis of information extraction using exact-match evaluation and the performance of the BioBERT and SciBERT models in recognizing named entities in scientific articles. The evaluation is based on entity-level precision and recall, with BioBERT achieving the highest F1-score in recognizing Genes/Proteins and diseases.

## Using the knowledge graph:

The section discusses the use of a knowledge graph (KG) to bridge the gap between humans and AI systems. The authors highlight the potential benefits for researchers and medical doctors to use the KG for interactive explanations and validation of diagnosis decisions. They provide an example of how a natural language query can be answered using the KG.
