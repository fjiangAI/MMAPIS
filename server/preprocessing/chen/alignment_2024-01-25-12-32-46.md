## abs
This paper proposes a new control signal called Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR) for Controllable Image Captioning (CIC). The VSR ensures event compatibility and sample suitability by including a verb and semantic roles. The framework consists of a Grounded Semantic Role Labeling (GSRL) model, a Semantic Structure Planner (SSP), and a Role-shift Captioning model. Extensive experiments on COCO Entities and Flickr30K Entities datasets demonstrate that the framework achieves better controllability and can generate diverse captions. Future work includes improving the captioning model, extending VSR to other tasks, and developing a more general framework.
## intro
This section introduces the Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR) control signal for Controllable Image Captioning (CIC). The VSR ensures event compatibility and sample suitability by combining a verb and semantic roles. The proposed framework includes a grounded semantic role labeling (GSRL) model, a semantic structure planner (SSP), and a role-shift captioning model. Extensive experiments on COCO Entities and Flickr30K Entities datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in achieving better controllability and generating diverse captions. Future work includes improving the captioning model, extending VSR to other tasks, and designing a more general framework.

## 3 Proposed Approach
This paper introduces a novel control signal called Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR) for Controllable Image Captioning (CIC). The VSR consists of a verb and semantic roles that ensure event-compatibility and sample-suitability. The proposed framework includes a grounded semantic role labeling model, a semantic structure planner, and a role-shift captioning model. Extensive experiments on COCO Entities and Flickr30K Entities datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves better controllability and generates diverse captions compared to baselines. The results highlight the effectiveness of VSR in improving the quality and diversity of image captions.
## experiment
The paper presents a novel control signal called Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR) for Controllable Image Captioning (CIC). The authors argue that existing control signals overlook event-compatibility and sample-suitability. VSR consists of a verb and semantic roles, ensuring event-compatibility and sample-suitability. The proposed framework includes a grounded semantic role labeling model, a semantic structure planner, and a role-shift captioning model. Extensive experiments on COCO Entities and Flickr30K Entities datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving better controllability and generating diverse captions. Future work includes improving the captioning model, extending VSR to other text generation tasks, and designing a more general framework for images without verbs.
## conclusion
The paper proposes a new control signal, Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR), for Controllable Image Captioning (CIC). VSR consists of a verb and semantic roles that represent an activity and the roles of entities involved. The paper introduces the grounded semantic role labeling (GSRL) model, semantic structure planner (SSP), and role-shift captioning model to generate captions based on VSR. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves better controllability than baselines on two benchmarks and can generate diverse captions. Future work includes improving the captioning model, extending VSR to other tasks, and designing a more general framework.
