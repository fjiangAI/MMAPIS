## Abstract
The paper proposes a new control signal, Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR), for Controllable Image Captioning (CIC). VSR ensures event-compatibility and sample-suitability by including a verb and semantic roles. The framework consists of a grounded semantic role labeling (GSRL) model, a semantic structure planner (SSP), and a role-shift captioning model. Extensive experiments on COCO Entities and Flickr30K Entities datasets demonstrate improved controllability and the ability to generate diverse captions. Future research directions include exploring more effective captioning models, extending VSR to other text generation tasks, and designing a more general framework.

## Conclusions & Future Works
This paper introduces Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR) as a novel control signal for controllable image captioning (CIC). The authors argue that existing control signals overlook event-compatibility and sample-suitability. VSR consists of a verb and semantic roles, ensuring compatibility with the described activity and suitability for specific image samples. The proposed framework includes a grounded semantic role labeling (GSRL) model, a semantic structure planner (SSP), and a role-shift captioning model. Experimental results on COCO Entities and Flickr30K Entities datasets demonstrate that the framework achieves better controllability and generates diverse captions. The paper's contributions include the introduction of VSR as a new control signal and its effectiveness in achieving controllable image captioning. Future work includes improving the captioning model, extending VSR to other tasks, and designing a more general framework.
