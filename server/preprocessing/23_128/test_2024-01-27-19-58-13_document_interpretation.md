### Comparison with extractive systems


The comparison of the proposed abstractive model with extractive systems reveals that extractive systems tend to achieve higher ROUGE scores. The subjective nature of the summarization task and the limitations of the ROUGE metric contribute to the difficulty of surpassing extractive systems.
### How abstractive is our model


The proposed model demonstrates various abstractive techniques such as truncation and composition of new sentences. Future work is suggested to improve the model's abstractiveness while retaining the advantages of the pointer module.
## Conclusion


The paper introduces a novel architecture for abstractive text summarization that addresses the limitations of existing models. The proposed model combines a hybrid pointer-generator network and a coverage mechanism to improve accuracy and reduce repetition. The model outperforms the current state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points on the CNN/Daily Mail summarization task. The paper emphasizes the potential for further research in achieving higher levels of abstraction in abstractive summarization.
