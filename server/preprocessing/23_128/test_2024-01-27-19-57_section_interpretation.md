## Abstract


The paper proposes a novel architecture for abstractive text summarization using a hybrid pointer-generator network and a coverage mechanism. The baseline model is a sequence-to-sequence attentional model, while the pointer-generator network allows for word copying from the source text. The coverage mechanism addresses the problem of repetition by maintaining a coverage vector. The model outperforms the state-of-the-art abstractive system by at least 2 ROUGE points on the CNN/Daily Mail summarization task.

The paper presents a novel architecture for abstractive text summarization that addresses the limitations of existing models. The proposed model combines a hybrid pointer-generator network, allowing it to copy words from the source text and generate novel words. Additionally, a coverage mechanism is incorporated to reduce repetition in generated summaries. The model is evaluated on the CNN/Daily Mail summarization task and achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art abstractive system. However, the summary lacks specific details about the limitations demonstrated in empirical analysis and the effectiveness, rigor, and challenges of the applied experimental techniques. Including such information would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the research.

It introduces a hybrid pointer-generator network that enables copying words from the source text and generating novel words. Additionally, a coverage mechanism is employed to track and control coverage of the source document, reducing repetition. The model outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the CNN/Daily Mail summarization task by at least 2 ROUGE points.
## Related Work


The paper builds upon existing literature in the field of neural abstractive summarization and pointer-generator networks. Previous research has primarily focused on extractive summarization methods, with limited attention given to abstractive methods for longer text. The authors highlight the limitations of previous approaches, such as inaccurately reproducing factual details, an inability to handle out-of-vocabulary words, and repetition.

To address these limitations, the authors propose a novel architecture that combines a sequence-to-sequence attentional model with a pointer-generator network. This hybrid model allows for both generating words from a fixed vocabulary and copying words from the source text via pointing. Additionally, the model incorporates a coverage mechanism to track and control coverage of the source document, reducing repetition.

The paper contributes to the field by applying the proposed model to the CNN/Daily Mail summarization task and outperforming the state-of-the-art abstractive system by at least 2 ROUGE points. The pointer-generator network's ability to handle out-of-vocabulary words and the coverage mechanism's effectiveness in reducing repetition are highlighted as major strengths of the proposed approach.

The paper also discusses related work in the field, including previous research on neural abstractive summarization, pointer-generator networks, and coverage mechanisms. The authors compare their approach to existing models and highlight the differences and advantages of their proposed methods.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to the field of abstractive text summarization by addressing the limitations of previous approaches and proposing an innovative model that combines the strengths of both extractive and abstractive methods. The empirical analysis demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model in terms of improved performance on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.
## Dataset


The paper uses the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, which consists of online news articles paired with multi-sentence summaries. The dataset contains 287,226 training pairs, 13,368 validation pairs, and 11,490 test pairs. The authors operate directly on the non-anonymized version of the data, which does not require pre-processing. The dataset supports the research goals by providing a large and diverse set of news articles and summaries for training and evaluation. However, the dataset may have limitations in terms of representing other types of text, such as scientific papers or technical documents.
## Experiments

The experiments in the paper utilized various techniques and procedures to evaluate the proposed models. The researchers used a baseline sequence-to-sequence attentional model, as well as a pointer-generator network that combines the baseline model with a pointer network. The coverage mechanism was also introduced to address the issue of repetition.

The models were trained with different configurations, including varying vocabulary sizes and training iterations. The researchers used a vocabulary of 50k words for both the source and target in the pointer-generator models. The baseline model was also tested with a larger vocabulary size of 150k. The pointer and coverage mechanisms introduced only a small number of additional parameters to the network.

The word embeddings were learned from scratch during training, and Adagrad optimization algorithm was used with a learning rate of 0.15. Gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 2 was applied to prevent exploding gradients. No regularization techniques were used. Early stopping was implemented based on the loss on the validation set.

During training and testing, the article was truncated to 400 tokens, and the length of the summary was limited to 100 tokens for training and 120 tokens for testing. This truncation expedited training and testing and was found to improve model performance. Beam search with a beam size of 4 was used for generating summaries at test time.

The baseline models were trained for approximately 600,000 iterations (33 epochs), similar to previous work. Training time varied depending on the model configuration, with the pointer-generator model requiring less training time compared to the baseline models. The final coverage model was obtained by adding the coverage mechanism and training for an additional 3000 iterations.

The researchers experimented with different values of the coverage loss weight (\(\lambda\)) and found that a value of 1 yielded the best results. Training the coverage model without the loss function or starting coverage from the first iteration did not lead to significant improvements.

Overall, the experimental techniques and procedures used in the research were designed to ensure the scientificity, reliability, and validity of the technical methods. The models were trained with appropriate optimization algorithms and hyperparameters, and the evaluation was conducted using standard metrics such as ROUGE scores. The researchers also performed thorough analysis and comparison with previous work to demonstrate the efficacy and limitations of their proposed models.

### Comparison with extractive systems


The comparison of the proposed abstractive model with extractive systems reveals some interesting findings. The extractive systems, particularly the lead-3 baseline, tend to achieve higher ROUGE scores compared to abstractive systems. The strong performance of the lead-3 baseline can be partially attributed to the structure of news articles, where important information is often presented at the beginning. In fact, using only the first 400 tokens (approximately 20 sentences) of the article resulted in significantly higher ROUGE scores compared to using the first 800 tokens.

The difficulty of beating extractive approaches and the lead-3 baseline can be attributed to the subjective nature of the summarization task and the limitations of the ROUGE metric. The choice of content for reference summaries is subjective, ranging from self-contained summaries to showcasing interesting details. With an average of 39 sentences per article, there are multiple valid ways to select 3 or 4 highlights in this style. Abstractive methods introduce even more options, such as phrasing choices, further reducing the likelihood of matching the reference summary. The inflexibility of the ROUGE metric is exacerbated by having only one reference summary, which has been shown to decrease its reliability compared to multiple reference summaries.

The subjectivity and diversity of valid summaries in the task suggest that ROUGE rewards safe strategies like selecting the first-appearing content or preserving original phrasing. While there are deviations from these strategies in the reference summaries, they are unpredictable enough that safer strategies tend to achieve higher ROUGE scores on average. This may explain why extractive systems tend to outperform abstractive systems, and even extractive systems do not significantly surpass the lead-3 baseline.

To further investigate this issue, the authors evaluated their models using the METEOR metric, which rewards not only exact word matches but also matching stems, synonyms, and paraphrases. The results show that all models receive a boost of over 1 METEOR point when considering stem, synonym, and paraphrase matching, indicating that they may be performing some level of abstraction. However, the lead-3 baseline still outperforms the proposed models. This suggests that the news article style makes the lead-3 baseline particularly strong across different evaluation metrics.

In conclusion, the results highlight the challenges of abstractive summarization compared to extractive methods in terms of matching reference summaries. The limitations of the ROUGE metric and the subjective nature of the task contribute to the difficulty of surpassing extractive systems. The findings also suggest the need for further investigation into the influence of news article style on summarization performance. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the limitations, innovations, and practical significance of abstractive summarization models.
### How abstractive is our model

Future work is suggested to improve the model's abstractiveness while retaining the advantages of the pointer module.
