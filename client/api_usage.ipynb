The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35; 2; 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38; 24; 15].\\n\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states $h_{t}$, as a function of the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ and the input for position $t$. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\n\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2; 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\n\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n\\n## 2 Background\\n\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\\n\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4; 27; 28; 22].\\n\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\\n\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17; 18] and [9].\\n\\n## 3 Model Architecture\\n\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5; 2; 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations $(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ to a sequence of continuous representations $\\\\mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n})$. Given $\\\\mathbf{z}$, the decoder then generates an output sequence $(y_{1},...,y_{m})$ of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\\n\\n### Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\n\\nEncoder:The encoder is composed of a stack of $N=6$ identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is $\\\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x))$, where $\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)$ is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension $d_{\\\\text{model}}=512$.\\n\\nDecoder:The decoder is also composed of a stack of $N=6$ identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position $i$ can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than $i$.\\n\\n### Attention\\n\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\n\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\\n\\n#### 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\n\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension $d_{k}$, and values of dimension $d_{v}$. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by $\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}$, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\\n\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix $Q$. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices $K$ and $V$. We compute the matrix of outputs as:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\\\mathrm{softmax}(\\\\frac{QK^{T}}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}})V \\\\tag{1}$$\\n\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}$. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\\n\\nWhile for small values of $d_{k}$ the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of $d_{k}$[3]. We suspect that for large values of $d_{k}$, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}$.\\n\\nFootnote 4: To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of $q$ and $k$ are independent random variables with mean $0$ and variance $1$. Then their dot product, $q\\\\cdot k=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{d_{k}}q_{i}k_{i}$, has mean $0$ and variance $d_{k}$.\\n\\n#### 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\n\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with $d_{\\\\text{model}}$-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values $h$ times with different, learned linear projections to $d_{k}$, $d_{k}$ and $d_{v}$ dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding $d_{v}$-dimensional\\n\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\\n\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\\n\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\n\\n$$\\\\mathrm{MultiHead}(Q,K,V) =\\\\mathrm{Concat}(\\\\mathrm{head}_{1},...,\\\\mathrm{head}_{\\\\mathrm{h}}) W^{O}$$ $$\\\\text{where }\\\\mathrm{head}_{\\\\mathrm{i}} =\\\\mathrm{Attention}(QW_{i}^{Q},KW_{i}^{K},VW_{i}^{V})$$\\n\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices $W_{i}^{Q}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{k}}$, $W_{i}^{K}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{k}}$, $W_{i}^{V}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{v}}$ and $W^{O}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{hd_{v}\\\\times d_{\\\\text{model}}}$.\\n\\nIn this work we employ $h=8$ parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use $d_{k}=d_{v}=d_{\\\\text{model}}/h=64$. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n\\n#### 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\n\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n\\n* In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38; 2; 9].\\n* The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\\n* Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to $-\\\\infty$) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n\\n### Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\n\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\n\\n$$\\\\mathrm{FFN}(x)=\\\\max(0,xW_{1}+b_{1})W_{2}+b_{2} \\\\tag{2}$$\\n\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is $d_{\\\\text{model}}=512$, and the inner-layer has dimensionality $d_{ff}=2048$.\\n\\n### Embeddings and Softmax\\n\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension $d_{\\\\text{model}}$. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by $\\\\sqrt{d_{\\\\text{model}}}$\\n\\n### Positional Encoding\\n\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension $d_{\\\\text{model}}$ as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\\n\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\n\\n$$PE_{(pos,2i)} =sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})$$ $$PE_{(pos,2i+1)} =cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})$$\\n\\nwhere $pos$ is the position and $i$ is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from $2\\\\pi$ to $10000\\\\cdot 2\\\\pi$. We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset $k$, $PE_{pos+k}$ can be represented as a linear function of $PE_{pos}$.\\n\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\\n\\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\\n\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations $(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ to another sequence of equal length $(z_{1},...,z_{n})$, with $x_{i},z_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}$, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\\n\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\n\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\\n\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires $O(n)$ sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\\\hline \\\\hline Layer Type & Complexity per Layer & Sequential Operations & Maximum Path Length \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline Self-Attention & $O(n^{2}\\\\cdot d)$ & $O(1)$ & $O(1)$ \\\\\\\\ Recurrent & $O(n\\\\cdot d^{2})$ & $O(n)$ & $O(n)$ \\\\\\\\ Convolutional & $O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d^{2})$ & $O(1)$ & $O(log_{k}(n))$ \\\\\\\\ Self-Attention (restricted) & $O(r\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d)$ & $O(1)$ & $O(n/r)$ \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\hline \\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\end{table}\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. $n$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the representation dimension, $k$ is the kernel size of convolutions and $r$ the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\n\\nlength $n$ is smaller than the representation dimensionality $d$, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size $r$ in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to $O(n/r)$. We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\n\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width $k<n$ does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of $O(n/k)$ convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or $O(log_{k}(n))$ in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of $k$. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to $O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d+n\\\\cdot d^{2})$. Even with $k=n$, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\\n\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\\n\\n## 5 Training\\n\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n\\n### Training Data and Batching\\n\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\\n\\n### Hardware and Schedule\\n\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\\n\\n### Optimizer\\n\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with $\\\\beta_{1}=0.9$, $\\\\beta_{2}=0.98$ and $\\\\epsilon=10^{-9}$. We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\n\\n$$\\\\small\\\\mathit{lrate}=d_{\\\\text{model}}^{-0.5}\\\\cdot\\\\min(\\\\mathit{step\\\\_num}^{-0.5 },\\\\mathit{step\\\\_num}\\\\cdot warmup\\\\_steps^{-1.5}) \\\\tag{3}$$\\n\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first $warmup\\\\_steps$ training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used $warmup\\\\_steps=4000$.\\n\\n### Regularization\\n\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:Residual DropoutWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of $P_{drop}=0.1$.\\n\\nLabel SmoothingDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value $\\\\epsilon_{ls}=0.1$[36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n\\n## 6 Results\\n\\n### Machine Translation\\n\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than $2.0$ BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of $28.4$. The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took $3.5$ days on $8$ P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\\n\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of $41.0$, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than $1/4$ the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate $P_{drop}=0.1$, instead of $0.3$.\\n\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of $4$ and length penalty $\\\\alpha=0.6$[38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length $+50$, but terminate early when possible [38].\\n\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n\\nFootnote 5: We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n\\n### Model Variations\\n\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \\\\hline \\\\hline \\\\multirow{2}{*}{Model} & \\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{BLEU} & \\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{Training Cost (FLOPs)} \\\\\\\\ \\\\cline{2-5}  & EN-DE & EN-FR & EN-DE & EN-FR \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline ByteNet [18] & 23.75 & & & \\\\\\\\ Deep-Att + PosUnk [39] & & 39.2 & & $1.0\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ \\\\\\\\ GNMT + RL [38] & 24.6 & 39.92 & $2.3\\\\cdot 10^{19}$ & $1.4\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ \\\\\\\\ ConvS2S [9] & 25.16 & 40.46 & $9.6\\\\cdot 10^{18}$ & $1.5\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ \\\\\\\\ MoE [32] & 26.03 & 40.56 & $2.0\\\\cdot 10^{19}$ & $1.2\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] & & 40.4 & & $8.0\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ \\\\\\\\ GNMT + RL Ensemble [38] & 26.30 & 41.16 & $1.8\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ & $1.1\\\\cdot 10^{21}$ \\\\\\\\ ConvS2S Ensemble [9] & 26.36 & **41.29** & $7.7\\\\cdot 10^{19}$ & $1.2\\\\cdot 10^{21}$ \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline Transformer (base model) & 27.3 & 38.1 & & $\\\\mathbf{3.3\\\\cdot 10^{18}}$ \\\\\\\\ Transformer (big) & **28.4** & **41.8** & & $2.3\\\\cdot 10^{19}$ \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\hline \\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\end{table}\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\n\\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]\\n\\nincreased the maximum output length to input length + $300$. We used a beam size of $21$ and $\\\\alpha=0.3$ for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\\n\\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\\n\\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-Parser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\\n\\n## 7 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\\n\\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\n\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\n\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor).\\n\\nAcknowledgementsWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n* [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35; 2; 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38; 24; 15].\\n\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states $h_{t}$, as a function of the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ and the input for position $t$. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\n\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2; 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\n\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n\\n## 2 Background\\n\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\\n\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4; 27; 28; 22].\\n\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].\\n\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17; 18] and [9].\\n\\n## 3 Model Architecture\\n\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5; 2; 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations $(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ to a sequence of continuous representations $\\\\mathbf{z}=(z_{1},...,z_{n})$. Given $\\\\mathbf{z}$, the decoder then generates an output sequence $(y_{1},...,y_{m})$ of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.\\n\\n### Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\n\\nEncoder:The encoder is composed of a stack of $N=6$ identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is $\\\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x))$, where $\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)$ is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension $d_{\\\\text{model}}=512$.\\n\\nDecoder:The decoder is also composed of a stack of $N=6$ identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position $i$ can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than $i$.\\n\\n### Attention\\n\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\n\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\\n\\n#### 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\n\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension $d_{k}$, and values of dimension $d_{v}$. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by $\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}$, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\\n\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix $Q$. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices $K$ and $V$. We compute the matrix of outputs as:\\n\\n$$\\\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\\\mathrm{softmax}(\\\\frac{QK^{T}}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}})V \\\\tag{1}$$\\n\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}$. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\\n\\nWhile for small values of $d_{k}$ the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of $d_{k}$[3]. We suspect that for large values of $d_{k}$, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}}$.\\n\\nFootnote 4: To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of $q$ and $k$ are independent random variables with mean $0$ and variance $1$. Then their dot product, $q\\\\cdot k=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{d_{k}}q_{i}k_{i}$, has mean $0$ and variance $d_{k}$.\\n\\n#### 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\n\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with $d_{\\\\text{model}}$-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values $h$ times with different, learned linear projections to $d_{k}$, $d_{k}$ and $d_{v}$ dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding $d_{v}$-dimensional\\n\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\\n\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.\\n\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\n\\n$$\\\\mathrm{MultiHead}(Q,K,V) =\\\\mathrm{Concat}(\\\\mathrm{head}_{1},...,\\\\mathrm{head}_{\\\\mathrm{h}}) W^{O}$$ $$\\\\text{where }\\\\mathrm{head}_{\\\\mathrm{i}} =\\\\mathrm{Attention}(QW_{i}^{Q},KW_{i}^{K},VW_{i}^{V})$$\\n\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices $W_{i}^{Q}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{k}}$, $W_{i}^{K}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{k}}$, $W_{i}^{V}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\text{model}}\\\\times d_{v}}$ and $W^{O}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{hd_{v}\\\\times d_{\\\\text{model}}}$.\\n\\nIn this work we employ $h=8$ parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use $d_{k}=d_{v}=d_{\\\\text{model}}/h=64$. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n\\n#### 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\n\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n\\n* In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38; 2; 9].\\n* The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\\n* Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to $-\\\\infty$) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n\\n### Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\n\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\n\\n$$\\\\mathrm{FFN}(x)=\\\\max(0,xW_{1}+b_{1})W_{2}+b_{2} \\\\tag{2}$$\\n\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is $d_{\\\\text{model}}=512$, and the inner-layer has dimensionality $d_{ff}=2048$.\\n\\n### Embeddings and Softmax\\n\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension $d_{\\\\text{model}}$. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by $\\\\sqrt{d_{\\\\text{model}}}$\\n\\n### Positional Encoding\\n\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension $d_{\\\\text{model}}$ as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\\n\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\n\\n$$PE_{(pos,2i)} =sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})$$ $$PE_{(pos,2i+1)} =cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}})$$\\n\\nwhere $pos$ is the position and $i$ is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from $2\\\\pi$ to $10000\\\\cdot 2\\\\pi$. We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset $k$, $PE_{pos+k}$ can be represented as a linear function of $PE_{pos}$.\\n\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\\n\\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\\n\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations $(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ to another sequence of equal length $(z_{1},...,z_{n})$, with $x_{i},z_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}$, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\\n\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\n\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\\n\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires $O(n)$ sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\\\hline \\\\hline Layer Type & Complexity per Layer & Sequential Operations & Maximum Path Length \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline Self-Attention & $O(n^{2}\\\\cdot d)$ & $O(1)$ & $O(1)$ \\\\\\\\ Recurrent & $O(n\\\\cdot d^{2})$ & $O(n)$ & $O(n)$ \\\\\\\\ Convolutional & $O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d^{2})$ & $O(1)$ & $O(log_{k}(n))$ \\\\\\\\ Self-Attention (restricted) & $O(r\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d)$ & $O(1)$ & $O(n/r)$ \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\hline \\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\end{table}\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. $n$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the representation dimension, $k$ is the kernel size of convolutions and $r$ the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\n\\nlength $n$ is smaller than the representation dimensionality $d$, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size $r$ in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to $O(n/r)$. We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\n\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width $k<n$ does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of $O(n/k)$ convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or $O(log_{k}(n))$ in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of $k$. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to $O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d+n\\\\cdot d^{2})$. Even with $k=n$, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\\n\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\\n\\n## 5 Training\\n\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n\\n### Training Data and Batching\\n\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\\n\\n### Hardware and Schedule\\n\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\\n\\n### Optimizer\\n\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with $\\\\beta_{1}=0.9$, $\\\\beta_{2}=0.98$ and $\\\\epsilon=10^{-9}$. We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\n\\n$$\\\\small\\\\mathit{lrate}=d_{\\\\text{model}}^{-0.5}\\\\cdot\\\\min(\\\\mathit{step\\\\_num}^{-0.5 },\\\\mathit{step\\\\_num}\\\\cdot warmup\\\\_steps^{-1.5}) \\\\tag{3}$$\\n\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first $warmup\\\\_steps$ training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used $warmup\\\\_steps=4000$.\\n\\n### Regularization\\n\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:Residual DropoutWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of $P_{drop}=0.1$.\\n\\nLabel SmoothingDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value $\\\\epsilon_{ls}=0.1$[36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n\\n## 6 Results\\n\\n### Machine Translation\\n\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than $2.0$ BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of $28.4$. The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took $3.5$ days on $8$ P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\\n\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of $41.0$, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than $1/4$ the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate $P_{drop}=0.1$, instead of $0.3$.\\n\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of $4$ and length penalty $\\\\alpha=0.6$[38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length $+50$, but terminate early when possible [38].\\n\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n\\nFootnote 5: We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n\\n### Model Variations\\n\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \\\\hline \\\\hline \\\\multirow{2}{*}{Model} & \\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{BLEU} & \\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{Training Cost (FLOPs)} \\\\\\\\ \\\\cline{2-5}  & EN-DE & EN-FR & EN-DE & EN-FR \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline ByteNet [18] & 23.75 & & & \\\\\\\\ Deep-Att + PosUnk [39] & & 39.2 & & $1.0\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ \\\\\\\\ GNMT + RL [38] & 24.6 & 39.92 & $2.3\\\\cdot 10^{19}$ & $1.4\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ \\\\\\\\ ConvS2S [9] & 25.16 & 40.46 & $9.6\\\\cdot 10^{18}$ & $1.5\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ \\\\\\\\ MoE [32] & 26.03 & 40.56 & $2.0\\\\cdot 10^{19}$ & $1.2\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] & & 40.4 & & $8.0\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ \\\\\\\\ GNMT + RL Ensemble [38] & 26.30 & 41.16 & $1.8\\\\cdot 10^{20}$ & $1.1\\\\cdot 10^{21}$ \\\\\\\\ ConvS2S Ensemble [9] & 26.36 & **41.29** & $7.7\\\\cdot 10^{19}$ & $1.2\\\\cdot 10^{21}$ \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline Transformer (base model) & 27.3 & 38.1 & & $\\\\mathbf{3.3\\\\cdot 10^{18}}$ \\\\\\\\ Transformer (big) & **28.4** & **41.8** & & $2.3\\\\cdot 10^{19}$ \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\hline \\\\end{tabular}\\n\\\\end{table}\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\n\\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]\\n\\nincreased the maximum output length to input length + $300$.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\n\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\n\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor).\\n\\nAcknowledgementsWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n* [1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Footnote 1: footnotemark: Footnote 2: footnotemark:\\n\\n## Abstract\\nThe paper presents the Transformer, a novel network architecture that relies solely on attention mechanisms and eliminates the need for recurrent or convolutional neural networks. The authors demonstrate the superiority of the Transformer model in terms of translation quality, parallelizability, and training time. They achieve state-of-the-art results on machine translation tasks, improving the existing best results by over 2 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and establishing a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task. The Transformer model also generalizes well to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing. The paper emphasizes the limitations of sequential computation in recurrent models and highlights the benefits of attention mechanisms for modeling dependencies in sequence tasks.\\n## Background\\nThis paper builds upon existing literature in the field of reducing sequential computation. It introduces the Transformer model, which relies entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned recurrent neural networks or convolution. The paper highlights the advantages of self-attention over previous models such as Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet, and ConvS2S. Self-attention allows for a constant number of operations to relate signals from two arbitrary positions, reducing the difficulty of learning dependencies between distant positions. Self-attention has been successfully used in tasks like reading comprehension and abstractive summarization. The innovation of the Transformer model lies in its reliance on self-attention and its ability to overcome the limitations of previous models.\\n## Model Architecture\\nThe paper presents a neural sequence transduction model with an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder maps input symbols to continuous representations, while the decoder generates an output sequence based on these representations. The model is auto-regressive, utilizing previously generated symbols as input for generating the next symbol. The architecture includes connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. However, the summary lacks information about the innovation of the model, as well as its efficacy and limitations demonstrated in empirical analysis. Additionally, it does not provide any details about the experimental or analytical techniques used, data collection and processing methods, or the effectiveness, rigor, and challenges of these techniques.\\n### Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nThe paper introduces an encoder-decoder model for machine translation tasks. The encoder consists of six identical layers, each with two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The decoder also has six identical layers, with the addition of a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the encoder stack\\'s output. Residual connections and layer normalization are used to facilitate information flow between sub-layers. The self-attention sub-layer in the decoder is modified to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with the offset of output embeddings, ensures that predictions for position $i$ only depend on known outputs at positions less than $i$. The mathematical formulas used in the model are not provided in the paper.\\n### Attention\\nThe paper introduces the attention function, which maps a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output. The attention function computes the dot product of the query with all keys, divides each by the square root of the dimension of the keys, and applies a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values. The paper presents the scaled dot-product attention as the specific attention function used in the model. It also introduces multi-head attention, where the queries, keys, and values are linearly projected multiple times and the attention function is performed in parallel on each projected version. The outputs are then concatenated and projected to obtain the final values. The paper provides the mathematical formulas for the attention function and multi-head attention. However, the summary does not include information about data collection, processing, and method analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness and rigor of the experimental or analytical techniques, numerical measurements should be provided.\\n### Positionwise FeedForward Networks\\nThe paper introduces a model called Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks, which is used in both the encoder and decoder layers. This model consists of fully connected feed-forward networks that are applied to each position separately and identically. The feed-forward network consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. The parameters of the linear transformations are different from layer to layer. The input and output dimensionality of the feed-forward network is 512, while the inner-layer has a dimensionality of 2048. This model is innovative in its use of position-wise fully connected networks and provides an effective way to process information at each position in the sequence. However, the paper does not provide empirical analysis or experimental techniques to evaluate the efficacy and limitations of this model.\\n### Embeddings and Softmax\\nThe paper employs embeddings and softmax functions in their sequence transduction model. Learned embeddings are used to convert input and output tokens into vectors of dimension $d_{\\\\text{model}}$. The decoder output is transformed into predicted next-token probabilities using a linear transformation and softmax function. The weight matrix is shared between the embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, following a similar approach in previous work [30]. The weights in the embedding layers are multiplied by $\\\\sqrt{d_{\\\\text{model}}}$ to scale them appropriately.\\n### Positional Encoding\\nThe paper introduces the concept of positional encoding in the model, which is necessary for capturing the order of the sequence. The authors add positional encodings to the input embeddings in the encoder and decoder stacks. They use sine and cosine functions with different frequencies to generate the positional encodings. Each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid, and the wavelengths form a geometric progression. This approach allows the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions. The authors experimented with both sine and cosine positional encodings and learned positional embeddings. They found that both versions produced nearly identical results. However, they chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to longer sequence lengths.\\n## Why SelfAttention\\nThe \"Why Self-Attention\" section of the paper compares self-attention layers to recurrent and convolutional layers in terms of computational complexity, parallelization, and path length between long-range dependencies. Self-attention layers have a constant number of sequentially executed operations, making them faster than recurrent layers for smaller sequence lengths. Convolutional layers require multiple layers to connect all input and output positions, increasing the length of the longest paths in the network. Self-attention also has the potential to yield more interpretable models.\\n## Training\\nThe training section of the paper outlines the training regime for the models used in the study. However, no specific details or techniques are provided in this section.\\n### Training Data and Batching\\nThe authors trained their model using the WMT 2014 English-German dataset, which consisted of 4.5 million sentence pairs. Byte-pair encoding was applied to encode the sentences, resulting in a shared source-target vocabulary of approximately 37,000 tokens. For English-French, a larger dataset with 36 million sentences was used, and the tokens were split into a 32,000 word-piece vocabulary. The sentence pairs were batched together based on approximate sequence length, with each training batch containing around 25,000 source tokens and 25,000 target tokens.\\n### Hardware and Schedule\\nThe models in the paper were trained on a single machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. The base models had a training time of approximately 0.4 seconds per step and were trained for 100,000 steps or 12 hours. The big models had a longer training time of 1.0 seconds per step and were trained for 300,000 steps or 3.5 days. This hardware and schedule information provides important details about the training process used in the study.\\n### Optimizer\\nThe paper utilizes the Adam optimizer with specific hyperparameter values for training. The learning rate is adjusted during training based on the model size and step number. The learning rate is increased linearly for the first $warmup\\\\_steps$ steps and then decreased proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. In the experiments, a value of 4000 was used for $warmup\\\\_steps$. The formula used for adjusting the learning rate is shown in Equation 3.\\n### Regularization\\nThe paper employs three types of regularization during training in the Transformer model: Residual Dropout, Dropout on embeddings and positional encodings, and Label Smoothing. Residual Dropout is applied to the output of each sub-layer, Dropout is applied to the sums of the embeddings and positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks, and Label Smoothing is used with a value of 0.1. These regularization techniques improve accuracy and BLEU score, although they hurt perplexity.\\n## Results\\n\\n### Machine Translation\\nThe paper presents the performance of the big transformer model in machine translation tasks. On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model achieves a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4, surpassing previously reported models by more than 2.0 BLEU. The training time for this model was 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even the base model outperforms all previously published models and ensembles, while being more cost-effective. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, the big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming all previously published single models at a fraction of the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The paper provides detailed information on the model configuration and hyperparameters used for training. The results and training costs are compared to other model architectures in the literature. The paper also estimates the number of floating point operations used for training based on the training time, number of GPUs used, and GPU capacity.\\n### Model Variations\\nThe paper investigates the importance of different components of the Transformer model by introducing variations to the base model. Specifically, the study focuses on English-to-German translation and measures the performance of these variations. The maximum output length is increased to input length + 300, and a beam size of 21 with an alpha value of 0.3 is used. The results demonstrate that the model performs remarkably well, surpassing all previously reported models except for the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar. Notably, even when trained solely on the WSJ training set, the Transformer model outperforms the Berkeley-Parser. However, it is important to note that specific numerical measurements were not provided to support the claim of superior performance.\\n## Conclusion\\nThe conclusion of this section highlights the significant contributions of the Transformer model in sequence transduction tasks. The authors emphasize that the Transformer, based entirely on attention, surpasses architectures using recurrent or convolutional layers in terms of training speed for translation tasks. They achieved a new state of the art on English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, outperforming even previously reported ensembles. The conclusion also outlines the future prospects of attention-based models, including their application to other tasks and the extension of the Transformer to handle input and output modalities beyond text. The authors express their research goals of investigating local, restricted attention mechanisms for efficiently handling large inputs and outputs such as images, audio, and video. Furthermore, they aim to make generation less sequential. The conclusion ends by mentioning the availability of the code used for training and evaluating the models. Overall, the conclusion highlights the transformative potential of the Transformer model and sets the stage for future research in attention-based models.\\n## Attention Visualizations\\n\\n'}"

       " 'message': 'Welcome to our discussion. Today, we will introduce a paper titled \"Attention Is All You Need,\" with primary authors including Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin. This paper presents the Transformer, a novel network architecture that relies solely on attention mechanisms and eliminates the need for recurrent or convolutional neural networks.\\n\\nThe authors demonstrate the superiority of the Transformer model in terms of translation quality, parallelizability, and training time. They achieve state-of-the-art results on machine translation tasks, improving the existing best results by over 2 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and establishing a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task.\\n\\nThe Transformer model also generalizes well to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing. The paper emphasizes the limitations of sequential computation in recurrent models and highlights the benefits of attention mechanisms for modeling dependencies in sequence tasks.\\n\\nThe paper builds upon existing literature in the field of reducing sequential computation. It introduces the Transformer model, which relies entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned recurrent neural networks or convolution. The paper highlights the advantages of self-attention over previous models such as Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet, and ConvS2S.\\n\\nThe Transformer model consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder maps input symbols to continuous representations, and the decoder generates an output sequence based on these representations. The model is auto-regressive, utilizing previously generated symbols as input for generating the next symbol.\\n\\nThe encoder and decoder stacks each have six identical layers. The encoder layers include a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The decoder layers also include a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the encoder stack\\'s output. Residual connections and layer normalization facilitate information flow between sub-layers.\\n\\nThe attention function plays a crucial role in the Transformer model. It maps a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output. The attention function computes the dot product of the query with all keys, divides each by the square root of the dimension of the keys, and applies a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values. The paper presents the scaled dot-product attention as the specific attention function used in the model. It also introduces multi-head attention, where the queries, keys, and values are linearly projected multiple times, and the attention function is performed in parallel on each projected version.\\n\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks are used in both the encoder and decoder layers. These fully connected feed-forward networks are applied to each position separately and identically, consisting of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\n\\nEmbeddings and softmax functions are employed in the Transformer model for sequence transduction. Learned embeddings convert input and output tokens into vectors of dimension d_model. The decoder output is transformed into predicted next-token probabilities using a linear transformation and softmax function.\\n\\nThe paper introduces positional encoding to capture the order of the sequence. Positional encodings are added to the input embeddings in the encoder and decoder stacks using sine and cosine functions with different frequencies. Each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid, allowing the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions.\\n\\nThe paper compares self-attention layers to recurrent and convolutional layers in terms of computational complexity, parallelization, and path length between long-range dependencies. Self-attention layers have a constant number of sequentially executed operations, making them faster than recurrent layers for smaller sequence lengths. Self-attention also has the potential to yield more interpretable models.\\n\\nThe training section of the paper outlines the training regime for the models used in the study. The authors trained their model using the WMT 2014 English-German dataset, consisting of 4.5 million sentence pairs. Byte-pair encoding was applied to encode the sentences, resulting in a shared source-target vocabulary of approximately 37,000 tokens. The models were trained on a single machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs, with different training times for the base and big models.\\n\\nThe paper presents the performance of the big transformer model in machine translation tasks. On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model achieves a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, the big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming all previously published single models at a fraction of the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Transformer model based on attention mechanisms surpasses architectures using recurrent or convolutional layers in terms of training speed and translation quality. The authors highlight the future prospects of attention-based models, including their application to other tasks and the extension of the Transformer to handle input and output modalities beyond text. They also express their research goals of investigating local, restricted attention mechanisms for efficiently handling large inputs and outputs such as images, audio, and video. The availability of the code used for training and evaluating the models is also mentioned.\\n\\nThank you for listening to our discussion on the paper \"Attention Is All You Need.'}"

    "The Multimodal Question Answering (QA) system comprises three distinct agents: the General QA Answering Agent, the User Intent Identifying Agent, and the Multimodal QA Answering Agent. Initially, the User Intent Identifying Agent processes your inquiry to ascertain whether it pertains to specific section details or image indices. For instance, questions like \"What is the main point in chapter 3?\" or \"What is figure 3 about?\"â€”or even more precisely, \"What is figure 0 in chapter 2 about?\"â€”assist the User Intent Identifying Agent in comprehending your query more effectively. Subsequently, based on the specificity of the intent identified, the task is routed to either the General QA Answering Agent for broader queries or the Multimodal QA Answering Agent for inquiries specifically concerning a section or image index.\n",
